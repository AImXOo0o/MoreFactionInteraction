    <!-- Faction war, favour one faction over the other -->

    <!-- Faction war, sabotage to benefit colony -->

As your caravan made a hurried departure, warriors from both factions caught up with it and attacked!\n\nRelations with {0} have broken down. They are now hostile towards you.\n\nRelations with {1} have broken down. They are now hostile towards you.</MFI_FactionWarSabotageDisaster>

    <MFI_FactionWarSabotageTriumph >The sabotage was a great triumph of sorts!

    <!-- Faction war, broker peace -->

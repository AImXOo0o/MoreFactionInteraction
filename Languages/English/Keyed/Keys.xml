    <MFI_FactionWarPeaceTalksIntroduction>The two opposing faction leaders {0} and {1} each made quarters in opposite corners of the make-shift camp. Tensions are high as your negotiator {2} walks in. The past few days have been taxing on all parties involved, and your negotiator knows that what they'll say can have far reaching consequences.\n\n{2} has the following options:</MFI_FactionWarPeaceTalksIntroduction>

    <MFI_FactionWarPeaceTalksCurryFavour>Curry favour with {0}</MFI_FactionWarPeaceTalksCurryFavour>

    <!-- Faction war, favour one faction over the other -->
    <MFI_FactionWarFavourFactionDisaster>The talks were a disaster. Neither faction appreciated your negotiator's attempt to butter up {0}. Efforts to seek out a victor in the strife were considered an act of aggression and the peace talks broke down as a result.\n\nRelations with {0} have deteriorated somewhat.\n\nRelations with {1} have deteriorated massively.</MFI_FactionWarFavourFactionDisaster>
    <MFI_FactionWarFavourFactionBackFire>The talks have backfired. While faction delegates discussed key differences, dissuasions your negotiator made were seen as unconstructive towards the goals and the talks soon broke down.\n\nRelations with {0} deteriorated.\n\nRelations with {1} have deteriorated massively.</MFI_FactionWarFavourFactionBackFire>
    <MFI_FactionWarFavourFactionFlounder>The talks floundered. Faction delegates expressed their key issues clearly, but your negotiator was not able to make any meaningful contributions to the peace talks.\n\nRelations with {0} have increased somewhat.\n\nRelations with {1} deteriorated considerably.</MFI_FactionWarFavourFactionFlounder>
    <MFI_FactionWarFavourFactionSuccess>The talks were a success.

    <MFI_FactionWarFavourFactionTriumph>The talks were a great triumph!

    <!-- Faction war, sabotage to benefit colony -->
    <MFI_FactionWarSabotageDisaster>The sabotage was a massive failure. The delegates quickly uncovered your negotiator's intent and both factions turned against you! Your caravan made a hurried departure, but warriors from both factions caught up with it and attacked!\n\nRelations with {0} have broken down. They are now hostile towards you.\n\nRelations with {1} have broken down. They are now hostile towards you.</MFI_FactionWarSabotageDisaster>
    <MFI_FactionWarSabotageBackFire>The sabotage has backfired. Not long after delegates exchanged pleasantries, they caught on to the unconstructive nature of your negotiator and excluded them from the talks.\n\nRelations with {0} deteriorated massively.\n\nRelations with {1} deteriorated massively.</MFI_FactionWarSabotageBackFire>
    <MFI_FactionWarSabotageFlounder>The sabotage floundered. Your negotiator proved unable to get a word in or provide meaningful contributions to the peace talks one way or the other.\n\nRelations with {0} and {1} remain unchanged.</MFI_FactionWarSabotageFlounder>
    <MFI_FactionWarSabotageSuccess>The sabotage was a dubious success. While delegates bickered over important issues, your negotiator navigated the political minefield and left an amicable impression on both factions while ensuring no actual progress was made.\n\nRelations with {0} increased considerably.\n\nRelations with {1} increased considerably.</MFI_FactionWarSabotageSuccess>
    <MFI_FactionWarSabotageTriumph>The sabotage was a great triumph of sorts! Delegates were expertly played out against one another, and not long after the initial greetings, the discussion broke down into insults and recriminations while both aggressors were left with a very favourable impression of your faction.\n\nRelations with {0} have increased immensely.\n\nRelations with {1} have increased immensely.</MFI_FactionWarSabotageTriumph>

    <!-- Faction war, broker peace -->
    <MFI_FactionWarBrokerPeaceDisaster>The talks were a disaster. The delegates barely got past their initial greetings before the discussion broke down into insults and recriminations. Nothing your negotiator said was met with any approval, and relations with both opposing factions are worse than before.\n\nRelations with {0} deteriorated.\n\nRelations with {1} deteriorated.</MFI_FactionWarBrokerPeaceDisaster>
    <MFI_FactionWarBrokerPeaceBackFire>The talks have backfired. Despite exchanging some pleasantries, the delegates made no progress on substantive issues, and multiple statements were interpreted as insults. They've decided to resume and reschedule the peace talks for a later date.\n\nRelations with {0} remain unchanged.\n\nRelations with {1} remain unchanged.</MFI_FactionWarBrokerPeaceBackFire>
    <MFI_FactionWarBrokerPeaceFlounder>The talks floundered.

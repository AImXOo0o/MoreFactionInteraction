The ~10 or so WorldObjects are instantiated by RimWorld.Planet.WorldObjectMaker.MakeWorldObject(WorldObjectDef def),
it takes the worldObjectClass from the def.

Everything except Sites is pretty straight-forward. 

TryFindSiteParams_SingleSite (SiteCoreDef, sitepartCandidates => out SitePartDef, out Faction <= [factionToUse])

- Sites themselves are blank slates. They can be populated by different things: Comps, SiteCoreDefs and SitePartDefs.

SiteCoreDef doesn't do much, but it's attached to a GenStepDef by the magic of <linkWithSite>SiteCoreDefName</linkWithSite>.
This adds the general layout and buildings to a blank slate.

Comps are comps. Nothing new. Mostly for meta

SitePartDefs are assigned by string. SiteParts have tags in a string form, and if the faction and tech level match the incident, 
that sitepart is a contender to be selected. 

GenStep pushes Symbols based on rules to the stack. idunno what happens when multiple of the same get pushed to the same stack.

There seems to be a difference between Site/Map owner and SitePart owner, or can potentially be.

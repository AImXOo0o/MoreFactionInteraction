# More Faction Interation

Adds more interaction with and between factions, bringing the world to life.

## Meaningful faction relations

- Build up trust and factions will reward you
- Cement relations by inter-faction marriages
- Help factions recover from different setbacks
- Factions may call upon you for labour
- Favours for favours
- Increased rate of world events

## Trade improvements

- Specialised traders desperate for certain goods
- More frequent traders, if you treat them right
- Traders get richer as you build up trust
- Traders bring higher quality as relations increase

## A living world

- Pirates spread out and grow outposts
- Pirates can demand tribute if they're close by - destroy their outposts!

## Warring factions

- Unrest is brewing between two factions! Will you pick a side, stay neutral or profiteer?

## TL;DR: More events

- Diplomatic marriages
- Reverse trade requests
- Bumper crops
- Hunter's Lodge
- Pirate extortion
- Faction WAR

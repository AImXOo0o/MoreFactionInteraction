Adds more interaction with and between factions, bringing the world to life.

<b>Meaningful faction relations</b>
- Build up trust and factions will reward you
- Cement relations by inter-faction marriages
- Help factions recover from different setbacks
- Factions may call upon you for labour
- Favours for favours
- Increased rate of world events

<b>Trade improvements</b>
- Specialised traders desperate for certain goods
- More frequent traders, if you treat them right
- Traders get richer as you build up trust
- Traders bring higher quality as relations increase

<b>A living world</b>
- Pirates spread out and grow outposts
- Pirates can demand tribute if they're close by - destroy their outposts!
- Show off your skills at the yearly exposition. Maybe you'll do well and be invited to host next year?

<b>Warring factions</b>

<b>TL;DR: More events</b>
- Diplomatic marriages
- Reverse trade requests
- Bumper crops
- Hunter's Lodge
